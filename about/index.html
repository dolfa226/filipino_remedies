                  </p>
                  <p class="body-type-about">
                    The topic of commercialized wellness intrigued me when I first began to notice the amount of vitamin supplements pages I scrolled through on social media. The branding and packaging was fun and light hearted with their playful typefaces and color schemes. These products attracted Millennials and GenZs. However, it all seemed a bit deceiving. These products at the end of the day fed into my overconsumption of products and the need for the right products that would help with my health, mood and appearance. I began to question what health and wellness looked like prior to this era. It also became apparent that many of these mainstream health trends stemmed from traditional and cultural practices yet they did not provide proper honor and acknowledgement.

                    Growing up, I would hear how my grandfather would chew bayabas leaves for his teeth or how I need to eat ampalaya because I ate too many sweets. This began my project of relearning traditional Filipino remedies as a response to mainstream media health trends.

                  <p class="body-type-about">
                    Traditional healing is ingrained in Filipino culture with documentation dating back to pre-Spanish colonization. People may often be skeptical of home remedies. However, they do contain cultural significance and have been successful for people. How can we highlight and share traditional health practices and remedies today?

                    Filipino Remedies is a resource designed to share traditional Filipino remedies as a response to mainstream health trends and the commercialization of food. These remedies are not intended to replace professional medical advice but serve as an alternative natural resource. The goal of this project suggests a return to natural processes and remedies which allow people to be more intentional about their consumption of food and health choices.
