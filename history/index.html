              Today, wellness surrounds us in forms of vitamin supplements, clean eating ads and juice trends. At the same time, we are surrounded by junk food marketing and processed foods. Both industries use branding and overused, friendly verbiage to lure consumers. Modern diets and the commercialization of wellness create a conflicting environment for consumers to make healthier choices for themselves.

              What is the role of traditional healing and home remedies in the future?

            <p class="body">
              Filipino Remedies is a resource designed to share traditional Filipino remedies as a response to mainstream health trends and the commercialization of food. It is vital to remember the cultural importance and health benefits of traditional healing and home remedies. The goal of this project suggests a return to natural processes and remedies which allow people to be more intentional about their consumption of food and health choices.
